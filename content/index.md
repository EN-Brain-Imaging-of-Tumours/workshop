# Registration

Registration is **free**. Nonetheless the space is limited. Preference will be given to people presenting some work, and promotion of diversity will be a criterion of choice.

To register, please write an email to [enetbrainimgtumours@gmail.com](<mailto:enetbrainimgtumours@gmail.com>) mentioning **ENBIT WORKSHOP** in the subject. Tell us about your interest in brain tumor imaging and data sharing, and specify if you would like to present something.

Please submit an abstract and an eventual request for student travel grant by **{{< deadline "abs" >}}**. You will be notified before **{{< deadline "not" >}}**. The final date to confirm your registration is **{{< deadline "reg" >}}**. **Please register only if you actually plan to come, otherwise food, money, and space will be wasted.**


# Travel Grants
We can offer four travel grants of 300 USD **to students and early career researchers**. Diversity and quality of the contribution will be the selection criteria. The money will be refunded to the grantee after the workshop. If you request a travel grant, please specify it in your email.

# Program

Complete program TBA (please consider contributing to it!).

So far we will have blitz presentation from the following consortium members:

-Hannelore Aerts
-Roland Beisteiner
-Linda Douw
-Anders Eklund
-Cyril Pernet

We aim to privilege open discussions, notably on metadata, sharing formats and solutions, and on standard advanced imaging (beyond the basic T1, FLAIR, GAD, DWI, which default data would be best to collect).
